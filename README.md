# <h1>ADAPTIVE SMART STREET LIGHTNING SYSTEM WITH DAY/NIGHT & MOTION BASED INTENSITY CONTROL</h1>

<h2>Introduction</h2>
<h5>Street lighting in urban environments is vital for ensuring safety, security, and accessibility. Traditional street lighting systems often operate on fixed schedules and lack adaptive capabilities, resulting in inefficiencies and excessive energy consumption. To address these challenges, this project proposes an adaptive smart street lighting system equipped with day/night and motion-based intensity control mechanisms.</h5>

<h2>System Design</h2>
<h5>The proposed system employs advanced sensors to detect ambient light levels and motion within predefined zones. During nighttime or low-light conditions, light sensors activate street lights at appropriate intensities, ensuring visibility while conserving energy during daylight hours or when adequate natural light is available. Motion sensors further enhance efficiency by adjusting lighting levels based on detected activity, dimming lights in areas with no motion to minimize energy consumption and reduce light pollution.</h5>
